### About
The chosen area or topic for this project is movies. The aim of the project was to create a movie database containing data essential to all users ranging from the average user looking for the description of a movie to somebody from the entertainment industry who is looking for additional information related to a movie such as the band or artiste of a song from the movie. The information included in the database covers a wide range of elements that can be of use to anybody seeking information related to a movie.
### Description
Movies are a form of entertainment to many people. Making a movie requires the collaborative effort of people with varied expertise. For example, producers are needed to plan and coordinate various aspects of a movie and the actors and actresses give life to the movie under direction of the director.
Simply put, a movie and the movie industry contain much data which should be made available to anybody who seeks it. This is facilitated with the use of a database. By centralising data in an orderly manner, users may access it efficiently.
The major functions of this database include the retrieval of information relevant to a movie such as the movie description, rating and runtime and other information which are attributed to a movie such as the soundtrack, songs of the soundtrack and artiste or band who played those songs. The people behind the movie are also included along with their respective roles such as actor, director and writer.
